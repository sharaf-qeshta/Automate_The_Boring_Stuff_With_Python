Umbrella Reminder
Chapter 12 showed you how to use the requests module to scrape data from
https://weather.gov/. Write a program that runs just before you wake up in
the morning and checks whether itâ€™s raining that day. If so, have the program
 text you a reminder to pack an umbrella before leaving the house.
